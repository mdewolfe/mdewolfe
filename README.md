## Hi

Currently I am working on a mobile application backed backed by Firebase. Four months ago I was working in the ecommerce space.

### This Week's Interest

Privacy. Looking into Passkey integration, and how to keep people's data private, or even question if it really is needed at all.

### Fun Fact

Snow can be found in a variety of colors, not just white! In certain conditions, you can find pink snow, commonly called "watermelon snow." This phenomenon occurs due to the presence of a type of algae, Chlamydomonas nivalis, that thrives in cold environments. The algae contain a pigment that gives the snow a reddish or pink hue, and it even has a faint scent of watermelon!
